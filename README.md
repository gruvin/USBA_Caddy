Gerber files in `./gerbers/` are compatible with [CopperCAM](https://www.galaad.net/coppercam-eng.html)[^ns] and FlatCAM-beta[^note][^ns], should you wish to CNC mill the board. That is, they use slightly older standards but shouldn't be a problem with modern fab houses.

I milled the two I needed quickly at home on my [Carbide3D Nomad 3 Desktop CNC machine](https://shop.carbide3d.com/products/nomad-3/nomad-3)[^ns]

Then ordered five more from [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcpcb.com)[^ns] for like $2 or something ... because why not? Puuurdy.

## Why though?

I wanted USB cables shorter but longer than available anywhere I could find. The will foudn the way? üòù


[^note]: Buggy. Crashes and stuff but works, mostly. Well ... it doesn't seem to know how to slot-mill. Actually, it's kinda crap in its current form. Shows promise though. Lots of cool DIY friendly features. *Do not delete tools from Tool DB* and **save often**! #ymmv. A Mac [Homebrew installer](https://github.com/tomoyanonymous/homebrew-flatcam) is available. The 'beta' cersion is actually the newer, working one. The non-beta won't work at all on a Mac.
